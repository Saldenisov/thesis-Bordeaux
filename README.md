# Bordeaux University Ph.D. Thesis Template
Ph.D. thesis template (LaTeX) with respect to the University of Bordeaux rules


This thesis template was done in 2013-2015 according to the rules of Universit√© de Bordeaux. It can be compiled with two different chains:
xelatex -- beamer -- makeglossaries -- xelatex -- xelatex
lualatex -- beamer -- makeglossaries -- lualatex -- lualatex


I, as the author recommend using MiKTeX or TeX Live as a \LaTeX distribution, and in my opinion best editors for general purposes are TeXStudio or TeXMaker.
